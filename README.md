- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Excalibur0126
- ðŸ‘€ I have a passion for video games and what makes them tick.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently seeking a degree in Information Technology.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord @ excalibur0126#3523 or Reddit @ excalibur0126.

I'm not very experienced with coding quite yet, but I'd love to learn! Right now, I'm looking into the disassembly of Pokemon games.
